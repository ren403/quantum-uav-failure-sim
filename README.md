# quantum-uav-failure-sim
Quantum simulation of thermal fatigue failure in UAV piston engines using Qiskit 

Summary  
This project uses Qiskit's Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to simulate how repeated thermal cycling affects molecular bonds — serving as an analog for micro-crack initiation in piston crown materials of UAV engines. By modeling the H₂ molecule at various bond lengths, the simulation provides insight into material stability under thermal stress.
